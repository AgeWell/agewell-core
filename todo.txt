The ride feature can even be a new tab, for an admin, completely separate from everything else. Customer facing, it can just say “call for ride”.

Admin, Like a standard field for when people ask to sign up for an email list. It just needs to be there somewhere. Make it simple.
- name (John Doe)
- date of ride requested (January 23)
- purpose of ride (doctor visit)
- location (SMDC 2nd street)
- one way or round trip (they could check a box even)
- special instructions
- assign driver (meaning just type in their name) or you could put the same drop down box from the volunteer database



Out Of Scope
If you can fix these things, then I will explain to Mary that we have a completed program. She keeps referring to the ride request function.  So we might  need to add a tab that says “request a ride” and it prompts a page to input “name, date, time, location,  reason for ride, assign person, map linked to address”
Item, qty, size(unit), brand, category, coupon price (if applicable), special instructions.
Store (in put chain and store location)
